# Parkinson-Disease-Detection
Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the nervous system. 
It results from damage to the nerve cells that produce dopamine (chemical that is vital for the smooth control of muscles and movement).
The causes of most cases of PD (known as ‘sporadic’ or ‘idiopathic’ PD) are still unknown but involve complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors.
The rate of misdiagnosis of PD is approximately 10–25%, and the average time required to achieve 90% accuracy is 2.9 years. 
Autopsy is still the gold standard for the confirmation of the disease . 
Therefore, this project designed an advanced convolution neural network model to predict Parkinson disease from both image and voice data. 
its prediction accuracy is less hence CNN is used in this project, 
a type of artificial neural network used primarily for image recognition and processing which filter data multiple times using neuron values so its prediction accuracy can be better. 
This project uses WAVE images of normal and Parkinson disease patients for imaging data and  Parkinson recorded voice is used for voice samples that detected by KNN with high accuracy.
